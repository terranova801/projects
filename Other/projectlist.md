To Do:
- Setup script for quickly copying bash_scipts to /usr/local/bin, chmod for correct files, etc so that I can quickly run programs like aws-connect
- Better file structure, maybe consolidate everything to /vault
- Same thing for alias' 
- Readme for everything as well
- Need to automate setting up git
	- Setting global username and user email
	- Setting up and grabbing public keys
	- Cloning repos
